# Problem Introduction
Imagine the year is 2020 and you are living in the densely populated city of Columbus, Ohio in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and you are starting to feel intense sickening pain. This alarms you, you want to find a place to get tested for a virus. However, testing may be in short supply and you are not sure where to go. The problem I am trying to solve is where testing locations should be set up in order to best test people from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Currently I have 3 sets of data. These are: four-square api data, zip code and demographic data, and a visualization with COVID-19 numbers by zip code. This will be used to solve the problem, by first understanding, what factors are likely to cause COVID-19, and where should testing locations be placed, in order to accommodate everyone to a fair and equal extent. With the four-square api I will get hospital and pharmacy locations, the reason for this is because it is reasonable for people to seek medical care from either location, and as a result people would go there.
