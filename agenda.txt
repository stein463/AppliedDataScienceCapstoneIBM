TODO List:
 
 - Try to construct and plot weighted clusters with Neural Networks to create weights.
 - Figure out how to apply agglomerative cluster.
 - Plot all this onto folium.
 - Figure out steps after those.





































-Create multiple files to help with interaction between files in the folder
-For each of the data frames put them into csv files and a seperate folder for the data
-Have a parent file which contains all the modules and files used for the project






- Data will contain the csv files executed
- scripts will contain all the code
    -This will contain multiple folders: collection, cleaning, and Analysis
        -Collection: The webscraping and other files to direct toward csv
        -cleaning: functions that clean up the data for usage in Analysis
        -Analysis: This should be the only file with .ipynb this analyzes everything and draws conclusions.
