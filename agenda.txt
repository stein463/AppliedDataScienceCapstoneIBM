The weighted Spearman KMeans was chosen for 10 clusters.
- Plot hospital and Pharmacy location


## Important info on python package:
for Columbus addresses use the package: 

### censusgeocode

This will be used to get the current testing sites (or the ones on the pdf)

In addition use these lines of code:

" import censusgeocode
dict(censusgeocode.address("717 E.17th Avenue", city='Columbus',state='Ohio',returntype='locations')[0])['coordinates'] "

Note: check to make sure the address info is filled if not try one below the location for the address number (not street number)and one above the number and average both of the coordinates out.

- Lastly create a data frame from that call it testing_sites_df and save it to a file called testing_sites.csv.

 






































-Create multiple files to help with interaction between files in the folder
-For each of the data frames put them into csv files and a seperate folder for the data
-Have a parent file which contains all the modules and files used for the project






- Data will contain the csv files executed
- scripts will contain all the code
    -This will contain multiple folders: collection, cleaning, and Analysis
        -Collection: The webscraping and other files to direct toward csv
        -cleaning: functions that clean up the data for usage in Analysis
        -Analysis: This should be the only file with .ipynb this analyzes everything and draws conclusions.
